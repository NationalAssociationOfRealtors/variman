        Hibernate is not itself a database. It is a lightweight object-relational
        mapping tool. Transaction management is delegated to the underlying database
        connection. If the connection is enlisted with JTA, operations performed by the
        <tt class="literal">Session</tt> are atomically part of the wider JTA
        transaction. Hibernate can be seen as a thin adapter to JDBC, adding object-
        oriented semantics.
    </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-basics"></a>10.1.&nbsp;Configurations, Sessions and Factories</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            A <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
            intended to be shared by all application threads. A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> 
            is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be used once, for a single
            business process, and then discarded. For example, when using Hibernate in a 
            servlet-based application, servlets could obtain a <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt> 
            using
        </p><pre class="programlisting">SessionFactory sf = (SessionFactory)getServletContext().getAttribute("my.session.factory");</pre><p>
            Each call to a service method could create a new <tt class="literal">Session</tt>,
            <tt class="literal">flush()</tt> it, <tt class="literal">commit()</tt> its connection,
            <tt class="literal">close()</tt> it and finally discard it. (The <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt>
            may also be kept in JNDI or in a static <span class="emphasis"><em>Singleton</em></span> helper variable.)
        </p><p>
            In a stateless session bean, a similar approach could be used. The bean would
            obtain a <tt class="literal">SessionFactory</tt> in <tt class="literal">setSessionContext()</tt>. 
            Then each business method would create a <tt class="literal">Session</tt>,
            <tt class="literal">flush()</tt> it and <tt class="literal">close()</tt> it. Of course, the 
            application should not <tt class="literal">commit()</tt> the connection. (Leave that to 
            JTA, the database connection participates automatically in container-managed
            transactions.)
        </p><p>
            We use the Hibernate <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> API as discussed previously,
            a single <tt class="literal">commit()</tt> of a Hibernate <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt>
            flushes the state and commits any underlying database connection (with special
            handling of JTA transactions).
        </p><p>
            Ensure you understand the semantics of <tt class="literal">flush()</tt>.
            Flushing synchronizes the persistent store with in-memory changes but
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> vice-versa. Note that for all Hibernate JDBC
            connections/transactions, the transaction isolation level for that connection
            applies to all operations executed by Hibernate!
        </p><p>
            The next few sections will discuss alternative approaches that utilize versioning
            to ensure transaction atomicity. These are considered "advanced" approaches to
            be used with care.
        </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-threads"></a>10.2.&nbsp;Threads and connections</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            You should observe the following practices when creating Hibernate Sessions:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
                    Never create more than one concurrent <tt class="literal">Session</tt> or
                    <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> instance per database connection.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    Be extremely careful when creating more than one <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                    per database per transaction. The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> itself keeps
                    track of updates made to loaded objects, so a different <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                    might see stale data.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> threadsafe!
                    Never access the same <tt class="literal">Session</tt> in two concurrent threads.
                    A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is usually only a single unit-of-work!
                </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-identity"></a>10.3.&nbsp;Considering object identity</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            The application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
            different units-of-work. However, an instance of a persistent class is never shared
            between two <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instances. Hence there are
            two different notions of identity:
        </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Database Identity</span></dt><dd><p>
                        <tt class="literal">foo.getId().equals( bar.getId() )</tt>
                    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">JVM Identity</span></dt><dd><p>
                        <tt class="literal">foo==bar</tt>
                    </p></dd></dl></div><p>
            Then for objects attached to a <span class="emphasis"><em>particular</em></span> <tt class="literal">Session</tt>,
            the two notions are equivalent. However, while the application might concurrently access
            the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different sessions, the two
            instances will actually be "different" (JVM identity).
        </p><p>
            This approach leaves Hibernate and the database to worry about concurrency. The
            application never needs to synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a
            single thread per <tt class="literal">Session</tt> or object identity (within a
            <tt class="literal">Session</tt> the  application may safely use <tt class="literal">==</tt> to
            compare objects).
        </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-optimistic"></a>10.4.&nbsp;Optimistic concurrency control</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
            interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
            not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction.
        </p><p>
            Maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the partial responsibility
            of the application tier, hence we call this process a long running
            <span class="emphasis"><em>application transaction</em></span>. A single application transaction
            usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomar if only one of
            these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
            simply read data.
        </p><p>
            The only approach that is consistent with high concurrency and high
            scalability is optimistic concurrency control with versioning. Hibernate
            provides for three possible approaches to writing application code that
            uses optimistic concurrency.
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-longsession"></a>10.4.1.&nbsp;Long session with automatic versioning</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                A single <tt class="literal">Session</tt> instance and its persistent instances are
                used for the whole application transaction.
            </p><p>
                The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> uses optimistic locking with versioning to
                ensure that many database transactions appear to the application as a single
                logical application transaction. The <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is disconnected
                from any underlying JDBC connection when waiting for user interaction. This
                approach is the most efficient in terms of database access. The application
                need not concern itself with version checking or with reattaching detached
                instances.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded earlier by the Session
session.reconnect();
foo.setProperty("bar");
session.flush();
session.connection().commit();
session.disconnect();</pre><p>
                The <tt class="literal">foo</tt> object still knows which <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                it was loaded it. As soon as the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> has a JDBC connection,
                we commit the changes to the object.
            </p><p>
                This pattern is problematic if our <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is too big to
                be stored during user think time, e.g. an <tt class="literal">HttpSession</tt> should
                be kept as small as possible. As the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> is also the
                (mandatory) first-level cache and contains all loaded objects, we can propably
                use this strategy only for a few request/response cycles. This is indeed
                recommended, as the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> will soon also have stale data.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-detached"></a>10.4.2.&nbsp;Many sessions with automatic versioning</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Each interaction with the persistent store occurs in a new <tt class="literal">Session</tt>. 
                However, the same persistent instances are reused for each interaction with the database.
                The application manipulates the state of detached instances originally loaded in another
                <tt class="literal">Session</tt> and then "reassociates" them using 
                <tt class="literal">Session.update()</tt> or <tt class="literal">Session.saveOrUpdate()</tt>.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded by a previous Session
foo.setProperty("bar");
session = factory.openSession();
session.saveOrUpdate(foo);
session.flush();
session.connection().commit();
session.close();</pre><p>
                You may also call <tt class="literal">lock()</tt> instead of <tt class="literal">update()</tt>
                and use <tt class="literal">LockMode.READ</tt> (performing a version check, bypassing all
                caches) if you are sure that the object has not been modified.
            </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions-optimistic-manual"></a>10.4.3.&nbsp;Application version checking</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Each interaction with the database occurs in a new <tt class="literal">Session</tt>
                that reloads all persistent instances from the database before manipulating them.
                This approach forces the application to carry out its own version checking to ensure 
                application transaction isolation. (Of course, Hibernate will still <span class="emphasis"><em>update</em></span>
                version numbers for you.) This approach is the least efficient in terms of database access. 
                It is the approach most similar to entity EJBs.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">// foo is an instance loaded by a previous Session
session = factory.openSession();
int oldVersion = foo.getVersion();
session.load( foo, foo.getKey() );
if ( oldVersion!=foo.getVersion ) throw new StaleObjectStateException();
foo.setProperty("bar");
session.flush();
session.connection().commit();
session.close();</pre><p>
                Of course, if you are operating in a low-data-concurrency environment and don't
                require version checking, you may use this approach and just skip the version
                check.
            </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-disconnection"></a>10.5.&nbsp;Session disconnection</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            The first approach described above is to maintain a single <tt class="literal">Session</tt> 
            for a whole business process thats spans user think time. (For example, a servlet might 
            keep a <tt class="literal">Session</tt> in the user's <tt class="literal">HttpSession</tt>.) For 
            performance reasons you should
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1" compact><li><p>
                    commit the <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> (or JDBC connection) and then
                </p></li><li><p>
                    disconnect the <tt class="literal">Session</tt> from the JDBC connection
                </p></li></ol></div><p>
            before waiting for user activity. The method <tt class="literal">Session.disconnect()</tt> 
            will disconnect the session from the JDBC connection and return the connection to 
            the pool (unless you provided the connection).
        </p><p>
            <tt class="literal">Session.reconnect()</tt> obtains a new connection (or you may supply one) 
            and restarts the session. After reconnection, to force a version check on data you aren't 
            updating, you may call <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt> on any objects that might have
            been updated by another transaction. You don't need to lock any data that you
            <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> updating.
        </p><p>
            Heres an example:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">SessionFactory sessions;
List fooList;
Bar bar;
....
Session s = sessions.openSession();

Transaction tx = null;
try {
    tx = s.beginTransaction();

    fooList = s.find(
    	"select foo from eg.Foo foo where foo.Date = current date"
        // uses db2 date function
    );
    bar = (Bar) s.create(Bar.class);

    tx.commit();
}
catch (Exception e) {
    if (tx!=null) tx.rollback();
    s.close();
    throw e;
}
s.disconnect();</pre><p>
            Later on:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">s.reconnect();

try {
    tx = s.beginTransaction();

    bar.setFooTable( new HashMap() );
    Iterator iter = fooList.iterator();
    while ( iter.hasNext() ) {
        Foo foo = (Foo) iter.next();
        s.lock(foo, LockMode.READ);    //check that foo isn't stale
        bar.getFooTable().put( foo.getName(), foo );
    }

    tx.commit();
}
catch (Exception e) {
    if (tx!=null) tx.rollback();
    throw e;
}
finally {
    s.close();
}</pre><p>
            You can see from this how the relationship between <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt>s and
            <tt class="literal">Session</tt>s is many-to-one, A <tt class="literal">Session</tt> represents a 
            conversation between the application and the database. The
            <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt> breaks that conversation up into atomic units of work
            at the database level.
        </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="transactions-locking"></a>10.6.&nbsp;Pessimistic Locking</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            It is not intended that users spend much time worring about locking strategies. Its usually
            enough to specify an isolation level for the JDBC connections and then simply let the
            database do all the work. However, advanced users may sometimes wish to obtain
            exclusive pessimistic locks, or re-obtain locks at the start of a new transaction.
        </p><p>
            Hibernate will always use the locking mechanism of the database, never lock objects
            in memory!
        </p><p>
            The <tt class="literal">LockMode</tt> class defines the different lock levels that may be acquired
            by Hibernate. A lock is obtained by the following mechanisms:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.WRITE</tt> is acquired automatically when Hibernate updates or inserts 
                    a row. 
                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.UPGRADE</tt> may be acquired upon explicit user request using 
                    <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt> on databases which support that syntax.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt> may be acquired upon explicit user request using a 
                    <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT</tt> under Oracle.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    <tt class="literal">LockMode.READ</tt> is acquired automatically when Hibernate reads data
                    under Repeatable Read or Serializable isolation level. May be re-acquired by explicit user 
                    request.
                </p></li><li><p>
            <tt class="literal">LockMode.NONE</tt> represents the absence of a lock. All objects switch to this
            lock mode at the end of a <tt class="literal">Transaction</tt>. Objects associated with the session 
            via a call to <tt class="literal">update()</tt> or <tt class="literal">saveOrUpdate()</tt> also start out 
            in this lock mode.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
            The "explicit user request" is expressed in one of the following ways:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Session.load()</tt>, specifying a <tt class="literal">LockMode</tt>.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt>.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    A call to <tt class="literal">Query.setLockMode()</tt>.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
            If <tt class="literal">Session.load()</tt> is called with <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>, and the requested object was not yet loaded by
            the session, the object is loaded using <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt>.
            If <tt class="literal">load()</tt> is called for an object that is already loaded with
            a less restrictive lock than the one requested, Hibernate calls 
            <tt class="literal">lock()</tt> for that object.
        </p><p>
            <tt class="literal">Session.lock()</tt> performs a version number check if the specified lock
            mode is <tt class="literal">READ</tt>, <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or 
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>. (In the case of <tt class="literal">UPGRADE</tt> or
            <tt class="literal">UPGRADE_NOWAIT</tt>, <tt class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</tt> is used.)
        </p><p>
            If the database does not support the requested lock mode, Hibernate will use an appropriate
            alternate mode (instead of throwing an exception). This ensures that applications will
            be portable.
